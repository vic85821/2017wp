      <h2>PROJECT</h2>
      <hr>
      <p><b>Design and Implement a High-Performance Concurrent Database</b></p>
      <p><i>C, Lock-free algorithm, Atomic Instruction</i></p>
      <p>
          In this experience, we use B+tree to implement a database and add the concept of "BULK". 
          According to the efficiency analysis, there are 10 times improvements than original database in performance.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Implement Folder Feature for HackMD</b></p>
      <p><i>node.js, Sequelize, eager loading</i></p>
      <p>
          HackMD is an online collaborative editor. We add folder feature that make users
          manage files more easier. The project includes API implementation and UI design.
          We use eager loading to decrease the query times and improve efficiency.
          (Still waiting for merge ... )

      <p><b>Multiplayer Card Game – UNO</b></p>
      <p><i>Java, multithread, UI design</i></p>
      <p>
          This program is my first cooperating project. We design algorithm to maintain at most
          8 players in a game. I learned about git version control and friendly user interface
          design.
      </p>
      <br>

      <p><b>Control Robots with Gestures and Body Movements</b></p>
      <p><i>C#, KinectSDK</i></p>
      <p>
          We use body movements to control Lego robots with Kinect. The robot can walk to
          specific location and pick up objects by its arms. This is my first project relating to CV.
          But I only understood how to use API for some specific actions but didn't know the implementation of those functions.
          It improves me to learn the details of CV.
